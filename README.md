# bytes.js

Bytes.js is a very small JavaScript library heavily inspired (and even borrowed)
from https://github.com/vjeux/jsDataView.

The idea is totally the same like in jsDataView, the only difference there is no aim to support old browsers.

So we just add some new and extra functionality that can be useful for you in some bleeding-edge projects.
